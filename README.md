XposedAllCapsNoCaps
===================

Control capitalization of text in all system and app text boxes

A simple Xposed module to globally change the case of text in Android system and apps. Currently working for TextViews, GL canvas, and EditTexts; text in browsers and other WebViews coming soon (hopefully).

Not the most practical module, but hopefully will serve as a good code example for anyone wanting to perform run-time processing of app text on Android.
